        As a squash player, I know how frustrating it can be when a referee makes a terrible call. I love watching PSA matches, but even at the highest level, a call can leave you flabbergasted. Now that squash is headed to the Olympics, it's more important than ever to shine a light on referee standards. So I decided to create a platform where squash fans like myself can vote on what you think the correct decision should be.

          I am currently working on adding more features to this platform. Some of the features I am working on include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Adding a comment section where users can use to discuss their thoughts</li>
          <li>Allow users to upload their own video</li>
