        As a squash player, something we can all relate to is being frustrated at a terrible call by the referee. I love watching PSA matches; however, sometimes, I get upset with a refereeâ€™s call, especially at such a high level. Especially now that squash has made the Olympics, it is important to bring awareness to referee standards. So I thought, why not create a platform where squash fans like myself can vote on what they believe the correct decision should be?
